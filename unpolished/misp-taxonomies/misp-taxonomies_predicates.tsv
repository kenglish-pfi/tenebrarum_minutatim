155	estimative-language	estimative-language	likelihood-probability	Likelihood or probability	Properly expresses and explains uncertainties associated with major analytic judgments: Analytic products should indicate and explain the basis for the uncertainties associated with major analytic judgments, specifically the likelihood of occurrence of an event or development, and the analyst's confidence in the basis for this judgment. Degrees of likelihood encompass a full spectrum from remote to nearly certain. Analysts' confidence in an assessment or judgment may be based on the logic and evidentiary base that underpin it, including the quantity and quality of source material, and their understanding of the topic. Analytic products should note causes of uncertainty (e.g., type, currency, and amount of information, knowledge gaps, and the nature of the issue) and explain how uncertainties affect analysis (e.g., to what degree and how a judgment depends on assumptions). As appropriate, products should identify indicators that would alter the levels of uncertainty for major analytic judgments. Consistency in the terms used and the supporting information and logic advanced is critical to success in expressing uncertainty, regardless of whether likelihood or confidence expressions are used.
156	estimative-language	estimative-language	confidence-in-analytic-judgment	Confidence in analytic judgment	Confidence in a judgment is based on three factors:   number of key assumptions required, the credibility and diversity of sourcing in the knowledge base, and the strength of argumentation. Each factor should be assessed independently and then in concert with the other factors to determine the confidence level. Multiple judgments in a product may contain varying levels of confidence. Confidence levels are stated as Low, Moderate, and High.

367	rsit	rsit	intrusions	Intrusions	A successful compromise of a system or application (service). This can have been caused remotely by a known or new vulnerability, but also by an unauthorised local access. Also includes being part of a botnet.
368	rsit	rsit	availability	Availability	By this kind of an attack a system is bombarded with so many packets that the operations are delayed or the system crashes. DoS examples are ICMP and SYN floods, Teardrop attacks and mail-bombing. DDoS often is based on DoS attacks originating from botnets, but also other scenarios exist like DNS Amplification attacks. However, the availability also can be affected by local actions (destruction, disruption of power supply, etc.) – or by Act of God, spontaneous failures or human error, without malice or gross neglect being involved.
369	rsit	rsit	information-content-security	Information Content Security	Besides a local abuse of data and systems the information security can be endangered by a successful account or application compromise.

This score considers the content and presentation of the message as well as the claimed sender identity. This determination also includes the content of any associated files; many times malware is injected into legitimate relevant documents.
403	targeted-threat-index	targeted-threat-index	technical-sophistication-multiplier	Technical Sophistication – Multiplier	The technical sophistication score is a multiplier ranging from 1 to 2 based on how advanced the associated malware is, including malicious file attachments as well as links to malware hosted on another system. We use a multiplier because advanced malware requires significantly more effort and time (or money, in the case of commercial solutions) to custom-tune for a particular target.

486	diamond-model	diamond-model	Adversary	An adversary is the actor/organization responsible for utilizing a capability against the victim to achieve their intent.	
487	diamond-model	diamond-model	Capability	The capability describes the tools and/or techniques of the adversary used in the event. It includes all means to affect the victim from the most manual “unsophisticated” methods (e.g., manual password guessing) to the most sophisticated automated techniques.	
488	diamond-model	diamond-model	Infrastructure	The infrastructure feature describes the physical and/or logical communication structures the adversary uses to deliver a capability, maintain control of capabilities (e.g., commandand-control/C2), and effect results from the victim (e.g., exfiltrate data). As with the other features, the infrastructure can be as specific or broad as necessary. Examples include: Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, domain names, e-mail addresses, Morse code flashes from a phone’s voice-mail light watched from across a street, USB devices found in a parking lot and inserted into a workstation, or the compromising emanations from hardware (e.g., Van Eck Phreaking) being collected by a nearby listening post.	
489	diamond-model	diamond-model	Victim	A victim is the target of the adversary and against whom vulnerabilities and exposures are exploited and capabilities used. A victim can be described in whichever way necessary and appropriate: organization, person, target email address, IP address, domain, etc. However, it is useful to define the victim persona and their assets separately as they serve different analytic functions. Victim personae are useful in non-technical analysis such as cyber-victimology and social-political centered approaches whereas victim assets are associated with common technical approaches such as vulnerability analysis..

537	kill-chain	kill-chain	Reconnaissance	Research, identification and selection of targets, often represented as crawling Internet websites such as conference proceedings and mailing lists for email addresses, social relationships, or information on specific technologies.	
538	kill-chain	kill-chain	Weaponization	Coupling a remote access trojan with an exploit into a deliverable payload, typically by means of an automated tool (weaponizer). Increasingly, client application data files such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) or Microsoft Office documents serve as the weaponized deliverable.	
539	kill-chain	kill-chain	Delivery	Transmission of the weapon to the targeted environment. The three most prevalent delivery vectors for weaponized payloads by APT actors, as observed by the Lockheed Martin Computer Incident Response Team (LM-CIRT) for the years 2004-2010, are email attachments, websites, and USB removable media.	
540	kill-chain	kill-chain	Exploitation	After the weapon is delivered to victim host, exploitation triggers intruders' code. Most often, exploitation targets an application or operating system vulnerability, but it could also more simply exploit the users themselves or leverage an operating system feature that auto-executes code.	
541	kill-chain	kill-chain	Installation	Installation of a remote access trojan or backdoor on the victim system allows the adversary to maintain persistence inside the environment.	
542	kill-chain	kill-chain	Command and Control	Typically, compromised hosts must beacon outbound to an Internet controller server to establish a C2 channel. APT malware especially requires manual interaction rather than conduct activity automatically. Once the C2 channel establishes, intruders have 'hands on the keyboard' access inside the target environment.	
543	kill-chain	kill-chain	Actions on Objectives	Only now, after progressing through the first six phases, can intruders take actions to achieve their original objectives. Typically, this objective is data exfiltration which involves collecting, encrypting and extracting information from the victim environment; violations of data integrity or availability are potential objectives as well. Alternatively, the intruders may only desire access to the initial victim box for use as a hop point to compromise additional systems and move laterally inside the network.

660	approved-category-of-action	approved-category-of-action	cat1	Cat1	Minimal Exposure - Passive Collection: CAT 1 actions provide the least exposure of an indicator, either through adversary observation or disclosure. Usage of the indicator is restricted to passive monitoring on Government or Cleared Partner networks, or through a classified passive capability or Operation. CAT 1 actions do not interact with or affect malicious network traffic.
661	approved-category-of-action	approved-category-of-action	cat2	Cat2	Moderate Exposure - Government or Cleared Partner Internal Active Collection: CAT 2 actions expose the usage of an indicator through non-disruptive collection techniques which require interactions with an adversary, within Government or Cleared Partner networks. While it is not the intent to disrupt the adversary it is possible that an adversary may discover they are subject to such techniques.
662	approved-category-of-action	approved-category-of-action	cat3	Cat3	Moderate Exposure - Government or Cleared Partner Internal Countermeasures: CAT 3 actions expose the usage of an indicator through inward-facing countermeasures. Malicious network traffic is affected in some manner, however the results are not directly observable to the adversary or external parties and is, therefore, more difficult to attribute as a deliberate action. Usage of the indicator is restricted to Government and Cleared Partner networks, or a classified capability or Operation. This implies a lower likelihood for non-approved disclosures.
663	approved-category-of-action	approved-category-of-action	cat4	Cat4	Moderate Exposure - Government Actions on External Networks: CAT 4 actions expose the usage of an indicator through actions which occur on internet accessible networks, without the authorization of the network or information owner. Such actions are conducted as classified Operations under the auspices of national legislative and compliance provisions. Action consequences are observable to the adversary and other, public parties and it is possible they may be attributed as Government sanctioned actions.
664	approved-category-of-action	approved-category-of-action	cat5	Cat5	High Exposure - Public Actions Which Enable Internal Countermeasures: CAT 5 actions expose the usage of an indicator through the public release of information which enables internal actions on networks not owned and controlled by the Government (i.e. industry, commercial or foreign governments). These actions are official public releases and are attributable as Government sanctioned actions.
665	approved-category-of-action	approved-category-of-action	cat6	Cat6	High Exposure - Actions on Adversary Infrastructure: CAT 6 actions expose the usage of an indicator through actions which occur on adversary owned networks, without the authorization of the network or information owner. Such actions are conducted as classified Operations under the auspices of national legislative and compliance provisions. Action consequences are observable to the adversary, and possibly other public parties, and it is possible they may deduce this as FVEY action.

821	DML	DML	8	Goals	"If the actor is part of a larger organized operation they may be receiving their goals from a higher level source or handler.  Depending on how organized and sophisticated the adversary's campaigns are, these goals may not even be shared with the operator(s) themselves.  In cases of non-targeted threat actors, this may be much less organized or distributed.
Goals are nearly impossible to detect (directly) but they're almost always the toughest question C-level leaders ask about post-breach.  ""Who was it and why?""  These kinds of questions can never truthfully be answered unless you're operating at Detection Maturity Level 8 against your adversary and can prove reliably that you know what their goals are.  Short of that, it's guessing at what the adversary's true intentions were based on behavioral observations made at lower DMLs (e.g. data stolen, directories listed, employees or programs targeted, etc).  I anticipate less than a handful of organizations truly operate at this level, consistently, against the threat actors they  face because it's nearly impossible to detect based on goals alone.  "
822	DML	DML	7	Strategy	" If the adversary's high level goal is to ""replicate Acme Company's Super Awesome Product Foo in 2 years or less"" their supporting strategies might include: 
1.  Implant physical persons into the companies that produce this technology, in positions with physical access to the information necessary to fulfill this goal.
2.  Compromise these organizations via cyber attack, and exfiltrate data from the systems containing the information necessary to fulfill this goal.
For less targeted attacks, the strategy may be completely different, with shorter durations or different objectives. The important distinguishing factor about Goals (DML-8) and Strategy (DML-7) is that they are largely subjective in nature.  They are very non-technical, and are often reflective of the adversary's (or their handler's) true intentions (and strategies for fulfilling those intentions).  They represent what the adversary wants.  For these reasons, they are not easily detectable via conventional cyber means for most private organizations.   It's very common for DML-8 or DML-7 to not even be on the day-to-day radar of most Detection or Response specialists, and if they are it's typically in the context of having received a strategic intelligence report from an intelligence source about the adversary."
823	DML	DML	6	Tactics	To successfully operate at DML-6, one must be able to reliably detect a tactic being employed regardless of the Technique or Procedure used by the adversary, the Tools they chose to use, or the Artifacts and Atomic Indicators left behind as a result of employing the tactic.  While this may sound impossible on the surface, it absolutely is possible.   In nearly all cases, tactics are not detected directly by a single indicator or artifact serving as the smoking gun, or a single detection signature or analytic technique.   Tactics become known only after observation of multiple activities in aggregate, with respect to time and circumstance.  As a result, detection of tactics are usually done by skilled analysts, rather than technical correlation or analytics systems.
824	DML	DML	5	Techniques	From a maturity perspective, being able to detect an adversary's techniques is superior to being able to detect their procedures.   The primary difference being techniques are specific to an individual.  So when respecting this distinction, the ability to detect a specific actor operating within your environment by technique exclusively is an advantage.   The best analogy to this is a rifled barrel, which leaves uniquely identifiable characteristics in the side of a bullet. Because of this, ballistics specialists can forensically match a spent round to the exact weapon from which it was fired with a high degree of certainty. Not just any weapon by calibur or model, but the exact weapon used to fire that specific round.  Human beings are creatures of habit, and most adversaries aren't aware of the fact that every time they attack they're leaving evidence of their personal techniques behind for us to find. The same applies for the tool builders writing the tools these adversaries use.  It's our obligation to find these distinctions and ensure we're looking for them.  It's personal behavior and habits that are the hardest for humans to change, so put the hurt on your adversaries by finding creative ways to detect their behaviors and habits in your environment.    
825	DML	DML	4	Procedures	"Given today's detection technology, and readily available correlation and analytics techniques, it's amazing that more organizations haven't reached Detection Maturity Level 4 for most of their adversaries.  Procedures are one of the most effective ways of detecting adversary activity and can really inflict the most pain against lesser experienced ""B-teams"".   In it's most simple form, detecting a procedure is as simple as detecting a sequence of two or more of the individual steps employed by the actor.  The goal here is to isolate activities that the adversary appears to perform methodically, two or more times during an incident. "
826	DML	DML	3	Tools	"Being able to detect at DML-3 means you can reliably detect the adversary's tools, regardless of minor functionality changes to the tool, or the Artifacts or Atomic Indicators it may leave behind.   Detecting tools falls into two main areas.  The first is detecting the transfer and presence of the tool.  This includes being able to observe the tool being transferred over the network, being able to locate it sitting at rest on a file system, or being able to identify it loaded in memory.
The second, and more important area of tool detection, is detecting the tool reliably by functionality.  For example, let's take a given webshell that has 25 functions.  If we want to claim DML-3 level detection for this webshell we have to exercise each of those 25 functions and understand what each of them do.  What do they look like at the host, network, and event log level when they are exercised?  We then aim to build detections for as many of those 25 functions across those data domains as we possibly can, reliably, balancing false positives and other constraints.  The reason behind this is simple, we want to be able to detect this version of the tool and as many future variants of the tool as we can by function that it performs.  If the adversary decides to change up 5 of the 25 functions for which we have detections, we're still detecting the entire tool.  In order for the adversary to use this tool completely undetected in our environment, they'll be forced to change every one of those functions; or at least the ones that we were able to reliably build detections against. "
827	DML	DML	2	Host & Network Artifacts	"DML-2 is where most organizations spend too much of their resources; attempting to collect what they call ""threat intelligence"" in the form of Host & Network Artifacts.  The reality is, these are merely just indicators that are observed either during or after the attack.   They're like symptoms of the flu but not the flu itself.   I often use the analogy ""chasing the vapor trail"" when I think of DML-2 because chasing after Host & Network Artifacts is much like chasing the vapor trail behind an aircraft.  We know the enemy aircraft is up there in front of us somewhere, if we just keep chasing this vapor trial we'll eventually catch up to the aircraft and find our enemy right?  Wrong.  Having a mature detection and response program means your operating above DML-2 and you're actually locked onto the aircraft itself.  You know how it operates, you know what it's capabilities are, you know the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures of it's pilot and you can almost predict what it's next moves might be.   This is precisely why good Cyber Intelligence Analysts will almost never attribute activity to a specific threat actor, group, or country based on just Host & Network Artifacts alone; they understand this DML concept and realize when they're likely just staring at the vapor trail.  They understand that in reality the vapor trail (indicators) could be from any number of aircraft (tools), with any number of pilots (actors) behind the stick."
828	DML	DML	1	Atomic IOCs	"These are the atomic particles that make up Host & Network artifacts.  If you're detecting at Detection Maturity Level 1, it means you are probably taking ""feeds of intel"" from various sharing organizations and vendors in the form of lists, like domains and IP addresses, and feeding them into your detection technologies.   Let me be clear on my position here.  There are a few, and I mean a very precious few, circumstances where this makes sense and can be done reliably.  These are edge cases where specific atomic indicators have a high enough ""shelf life"" where it makes sense to go ahead and create detection capabilities from them.  Examples of this include unique strings found inside a binary, or perhaps an adversary is foolish enough to sit on the same recon, delivery, C2, or exfiltration infrastructure allowing you to detect reliably on their domain names or IP addresses.  These might be viable cases where detecting on atomic indicator alone makes sense.   Unfortunately, for the remaining 99% of the time, attempting to detect on this kind of data is suboptimal, for a number of reasons."
829	DML	DML	0	None or Unknown	For organizations who either don't operate at DML-1 or higher, or they don't even know where they operate on this scale, we have Detection Maturity Level - 0.   Instead of pointing out all the negative things associated with this level, I'll take the high road and lend a bit of positive encouragement.   Congratulations, you are at ground zero.  It can only get better from here.
