# es_liberare_py An Elastic Search Bulk Data Dumper in Bash and Python

### Usage:
```bash
chmod a+x bulk_dump.sh
./bulk_dump.sh $HOST $INDEX
```

### Output:

#### Index Definition File

One file named `create_index--$HOST--$INDEX.idx.json` will be created 
which is derived from the output of the command `http://'$HOST':9200/'$INDEX'/_settings,_mapping/?pretty` 
and which can be passed directly back to the target Elasticsearch server to re-create the index definition:
```
curl -XPOST http://$TARGETHOST:9200/$INDEX -d @$HOST--$INDEX.create_index.json
```

#### Many Bulk Dump Files

Multiple bulk dump files per document type are created.  Each file contains up to 1000 entries
from the original index.  These can be posted to the target server with the following (NOTE the use of --binary-data)
```
for F in bulk--*
do
    curl -XPOST http://$TARGETHOST:9200/$INDEX/_bulk --binary-data @$F
done
```

#### CAUTIONs

**!Please Add to this list as issues arrise:**

1. The index definition can contain implicit references to plug-ins.  Plugins should be checked on the target system before re-ingesting data.
